## 💡 About This Project

I built this project as part of my learning journey in full-stack development. My focus was not just on completing functionality but on understanding how each piece of the MERN stack integrates. From database modeling and secure authentication to frontend routing and state management, this project was a hands-on dive into real-world application architecture.

I truly enjoyed working on this and plan to continue enhancing it with more features and deployment.
